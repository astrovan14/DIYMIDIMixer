# DIYMIDIMixer
ENES 100 project to make a MIDI mixer mostly for windows audio.
The .prt and .asm CAD files are for Creo Parametric 6.0 and above, while the .stl files can be opened on many CAD programs.
The circuit file can be modified in fritzing, but if you only need to view the schematic there are some images.
The code is written for the QT Py, but in theory will work for any board with simple pin number changes.
